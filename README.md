# Desafio_ReactJS

## Rockeseat's React JS challenge
This challenge integrates a web React interface with the backend created in desafio_nodejs. 
To install all the necessary dependencies, just run **yarn**. 

## Implemented uses:

- List all the repositories in the API(backend): creates a list with the field title of all the repositories that are stored in the API. 

- Add a repository to the API: adds a new item in the API using the "Adicionar" button and after creating it, its name must also be displayed.

- Removing a repository from the API: for each item on the list, it must have a delete button. When the button is clicked, it will call a function that removes this item from both the frontend and backend. 

# Testing if everything is working:

Just run the command **yarn test** and it will test if the repositories are being added and removed correctly.
